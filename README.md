# Virus_RNA-seq_tutorial

This repo contains the materials for a tutorial for mining viral sequences from RNA-Seq data, posted on UC Berkeley's D-Lab Medium. The tutorial is compatible with Linux HPC systems with Anaconda, Git, Python, and SPAdes downloaded and available as modules. <br>
<br>
Workshop materials:
**programs/download_programs.sh**  *script to download programs required for the tutorial* <br>
**data/download_data.sh**          *script to download raw RNA-Seq data from NCBI* <br>
**data/run_fastp.sh**              *script to clean raw data with FastP* <br>
**data/run_bbnorm.sh**             *script to normalize cleaned data with BBNorm within BBMap* <br>
**data/MVP/mvp_metadata.txt**      *metadata file to map assemblies and normalized sequences in MVP* <br>
